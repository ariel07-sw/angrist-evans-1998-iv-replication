# Angrist & Evans (1998) — IV / 2SLS Replication (Phase 1)

## Track & Paper
- **Track:** Track B (Replication)
- **Paper:** Angrist, Joshua D. & Evans, William N. (1998). *Children and Their Parents’ Labor Supply: Evidence from Exogenous Variation in Family Size*.

## Research Question (Causal)
This project replicates the core causal question in Angrist & Evans (1998): **Does having an additional child causally affect mothers’ labor supply outcomes (e.g., employment and hours worked)?**  
Because family size is endogenous, the paper uses **instrumental variables (IV)**—notably **the occurrence of same-sex first two children** (and related fertility instruments)—to generate exogenous variation in fertility and estimate the causal effect via **2SLS**.

## Data Source
Data come from **Joshua Angrist’s MIT data archive** (AngEv98.zip), which includes extracts based on the **1980 and 1990 U.S. Census**.

> **Note:** Raw data files are not uploaded to GitHub due to size limits. This repository preserves the required folder structure and provides instructions to reproduce results locally.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md` — project overview and run instructions  
- `data/raw/` — **raw input data** (not tracked in git; contains placeholder `.gitkeep`)  
- `data/processed/` — **processed outputs** generated by notebooks (not tracked in git; contains placeholder `.gitkeep`)  
- `notebooks/01_Data_Cleaning.ipynb` — Phase 1 ingestion notebook (SAS → CSV, preview with `.head()`)  
- `notebooks/02_Replication.ipynb` — replication notebook (IV/2SLS estimation)

---

## How to Run (Phase 1)
1. **Download the dataset** (AngEv98.zip) from the MIT data archive.
2. Extract the raw files and place the required `.sas7bdat` files into:
   - `data/raw/m_d_806.sas7bdat`
   - `data/raw/m_d_903.sas7bdat`
3. Open and run:
   - `notebooks/01_Data_Cleaning.ipynb`

### Expected Phase 1 Output
- The notebook should successfully load the raw data using `pandas.read_sas(...)`
- Display `df.head()` for each dataset to confirm ingestion
- (Optional but recommended) Write processed CSVs to:
  - `data/processed/census_806.csv`
  - `data/processed/census_903.csv`

## Notes on Git Tracking
This repo intentionally does **not** track large data files. Folder structure is preserved with `.gitkeep` files:
- `data/raw/.gitkeep`
- `data/processed/.gitkeep`

If you need to reproduce locally, follow the steps above to place raw data under `data/raw/`.
